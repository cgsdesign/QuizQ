//# Sentence Reversal
// Given any sentence, reverse the order that the words are in. So, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" might read "dog lazy the over jumped fox brown quick The" when reversed.

//start with a string
//make sentence a object
//enter sentense array - split(sentenceObject) or
// inverse array order reverse(sentenceArray)
//
// sentenseArray.join(' ')



var sentenceEl = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy do."

var reverseSentence = function(words){
   words = words.split(" ")//split by spaces//this is now an array
   console.log(words)


}
